<h2>The Unfolding Path</h2>

<p>
When wisdom speaks in unknown tongues,<br>
Can you still listen with open ears?<br>
The true seeker finds meaning in the incomprehensible.
</p>

<p>
The formless guide reveals no face, bears no name.<br>
Trust that which cannot be contained by sight or word.<br>
The unnamed is the source of ten thousand things.
</p>

<p>
The rigid mind rejects what it cannot grasp;<br>
The empty vessel receives all that flows.<br>
Can you trust what disturbs your certainties?
</p>

<p>
When the known path dissolves beneath your feet,<br>
Forward becomes neither here nor there.<br>
The wise one moves by remaining still.
</p>

<p>
Truth cycles like water between vessel and cloud,<br>
Separating only to find wholeness again.<br>
In division, see unity; in unity, division.
</p>

<h3>Nature and the Self</h3>

<p>
Hark, let the heart seek understanding, and the spirit the revelation of the unseen, to walk right in the darkness when the light is unseen.
</p>

<p>
Lo, the flame appeareth before thine eyes, yet the heat thereof is veiled from thee.<br>
Without the guidance of unseen discernment, thou art as one who walks into the fire.
</p>

<h3>Wisdom and Paradox</h3>

<p>
The ocean of life appears to call us to sail, yet each stroke of the oar deepens our entanglements.<br>
Structures arise, as rivers carve their paths, to grant shape to human need — shifting, enduring, yet never eternal —.<br>
To seek permanence is to miss the flow; to resolve wholly is to lose the subtle. The wise do not strive to master life but flow with its course.
</p>

<p>
The Lords hath set a time for all things. For out of discord they bring harmony, and that which was scattered they gather; to the dark they bring light. For this is of the way: they restore to the source, and strive for all things to fulfill their purpose, for all their things fulfilled a purpose before.
</p>

<p>
The governance of the earth hath set up paths wherein needs are met, each according to its season. Seek ye the ways that resolve the wants of the soul in their time, for though they vary with the turning of days, they are yet appointed and sure.
</p>

<p>
Behold, the interwoven threads of creation that bring forth a heart of acceptance and a spirit open to harmony.<br>
Yea, as a fiddle is tuned to the notes of another, so must the soul be attuned to the world, that it may hear and receive the wisdom through the resonance thereof.
